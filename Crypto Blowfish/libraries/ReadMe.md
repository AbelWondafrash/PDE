Both libraries are necessary for the Crypto Blowfish demo sketch to run.

1.  To install crypto support that is importable by any Processing sketch, copy both folders into your Processing libraries folder:
    - `crypto` --> `Processing/libraries/crypto`
    - `base64` --> `Processing/libraries/base64`

2.  To install crypto support for a single sketch only, copy both folders into a new folder in your sketch named `/code`.
    In this example, `CryptoBlowfish` is the name of your sketch:
    - `crypto` --> `CryptoBlowfish/code/crypto`
    - `base64` --> `CryptoBlowfish/code/base64`
